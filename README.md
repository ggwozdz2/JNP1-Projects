# JNP1-Projects
Projects created during "anguages and tools for programming I" (Języki i narzędzia programowania 1) during the academic year 2022/23 at University of Warsaw.

Throughout this course, we have learned programming paradigms in C+ (OOP, functional, imperative).

The projects were made in groups of two or three, time to make each one was approximately 2 weeks.
